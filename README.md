Using text similarities to create clusters around topics in COVID19 literature and identifying the edges between topics that can be important. Say, for example, there is a cluster of articles that talk about vaccines and another cluster about COVID19 in cats. If there was an edge that connected those 2 topics, then we know there it an article talking about vaccines with COVID19 cats. Any maybe being able to identify something like this can expediate the research process in coming up with a human vaccine. Just Maybe...
