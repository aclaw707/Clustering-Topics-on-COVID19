Using text similarities to create clusters around topics in COVID19 literature. Identifying the edges between topics that can be relevant. Say, for example, there is a cluster of articles that talk about vaccines and another cluster about COVID19 in cats. If there was an edge that connected those 2 topics, then we know there it an article talking about vaccines for cats with COVID19. Any maybe this identification of relevant information can be helpful in developing a vaccine for humans safely and more quickly.
